So, I'm a lead team at good that work on machine intelligence.
In other words, the engineer descipline of making computers and devices able to do some of the things that brains do.
and this makes us interested in real brains and neuroscience as well, 
and especially interested in the things that our brains do that are still far superior to the performence of computers.
